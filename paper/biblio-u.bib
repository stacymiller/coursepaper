  Abstract                 = { If options are correctly priced in the market, it should not be possible to make sure profits by creating portfolios of long and short positions in options and their underlying stocks. Using this principle, a theoretical valuation formula for options is derived. Since almost all corporate liabilities can be viewed as combinations of options, the formula and the analysis that led to it are also applicable to corporate liabilities such as common stock, corporate bonds, and warrants. In particular, the formula can be used to derive the discount that should be applied to a corporate bond because of the possibility of default. },

  Abstract                 = {Quasi-Monte Carlo simulation is a popular numerical method in applications, in particular, economics and finance. Since the normal distribution occurs frequently in economic and financial modeling, one often needs a method to transform low-discrepancy sequences from the uniform distribution to the normal distribution. Two well known methods used with pseudorandom numbers are the Box–Muller and the inverse transformation methods. Some researchers and financial engineers have claimed that it is incorrect to use the Box–Muller method with low-discrepancy sequences, and instead, the inverse transformation method should be used. In this paper we prove that the Box–Muller method can be used with low-discrepancy sequences, and discuss when its use could actually be advantageous. We also present numerical results that compare Box–Muller and inverse transformation methods. },
